## Vaccine Intention & Data Visualization

This repository contains the two files you will work with for the March 9, 2021 R-Ladies St. Louis workshop by Zoey Dlott & Megan Richard. The two files are:

* participant-document-vaccination-intention.Rmd (this is the code file for the workshop)

* vaccine_intention.csv (this is the data file for the workshop)

The repository also contains this README file, which you will not need for the workshop.


## Downloading the files 

To download the files in the repository, click on the green "Code" button and choose the "Download ZIP." Once you have downloaded the zip, open it and save the code and data files somewhere you can find them. Remember to **save both these files in the same folder** so that the code will work as intended. You will not need the README file and can delete it.
